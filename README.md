Back in the day, media organizations needed to make sure what they were 
printing was as accurate as possible, because once the words were on paper, and
the paper was in someone's hands, there was no changing it. This is still the
case today for the print newspapers that still survive.

However the same is not true on the web, where stories can be quickly changed
and updated as new facts arrive, and more is learned. Many news outlets treat
the web as their place for working drafts, which allows them to craft a story in
near real time, which gives them the opportunity of being the first to publish a
breaking news story.

But news travels fast in social media. What if you don't subscribe to the print
newspaper anymore? And what if that initial, perhaps flawed version goes viral,
and it is the only version you ever read? It's not exactly *fake news*, because
there's no intent to mislead. But it may not be the best news either.

diffengine is a utility for watching RSS feeds to see when story
content changes. When new content is found a snapshot is saved at the Internet
Archive, and a diff is generated for sending to social media. The hope is that
it can help draw attention to the way news is being shaped on the web.

Thanks for the inspiration of [nyt_diff] and [NewsDiffs] which *almost* did what
was needed, but not quite. I wanted something that would work with any site that
publishes a feed, and would publish to social media instead of creating a new
site for people to track.
